Implement a method **`get_info()`** that returns a string containing the manufacturer and model of the vehicle. Then, create two derived classes(Inherited Classes), **Car and Motorcycle**, that inherit from Vehicle. Each derived class should have an additional attribute and override the **`get_info()`** method to include the new attribute's value. Finally, create instances of both classes and print their information."
