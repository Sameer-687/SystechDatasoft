        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will be implementing a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and training it on the CIFAR-100 dataset using PyTorch. The CIFAR-100 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes, with 600 images per class.\n",

        "\n",
        "Your first task is to implement a simple CNN architecture that can be used for image classification on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The CNN architecture should consist of the following layers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Convolutional Layer 1: 32 filters, kernel size 3x3, activation: ReLU, padding: same.\n",
        "2. MaxPooling Layer 1: Pool size 2x2.\n",
        "3. Convolutional Layer 2: 64 filters, kernel size 3x3, activation: ReLU, padding: same.\n",
        "4. MaxPooling Layer 2: Pool size 2x2.\n",
        "5. Flatten Layer: To flatten the 2D feature maps into a 1D vector.\n",
        "6. Dense Layer 1: 128 units, activation: ReLU.\n",

        "\n",
        "After successfully implementing and training the CNN model, your next task is to evaluate its performance on a separate validation dataset. For this task, split the CIFAR-100 training dataset into training and validation sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for validation). Then, calculate and print the accuracy of the model on the validation set.\n",

        "\n",
        "To gain insights into the training process, your final task is to visualize the training and validation accuracy and loss over the 20 epochs. Plot two separate graphs: one for accuracy and another for loss. This will help you understand how well the model is learning from the training data and how it generalizes to the validation set.\n",

        "\n",
        "Finally, print the number of parameters the network has and the names of each layer in the network. This will help you understand the model's complexity and architecture.\n",
        "\n",
